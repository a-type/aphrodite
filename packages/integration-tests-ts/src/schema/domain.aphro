# & GraphQL {} -- expose what things to GraphQL clients
#  ^-- do we even need? If we allow clients to query in our generated query language
#    then we can just persist their plans and use those as our APIs
#  ^-- via generating "wire" clients
# & Triggers { typescript: ``, c#: ``, ...} -- would we want to do arbitrary code injection?
