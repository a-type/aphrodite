`packages` contains all the individual packages that can be pieced together to have all or some Aphrodite functionality.

`packages-aggregate` aggregates packages together that would be used together in the vast majority of cases.

E.g., incorporating all `component-runtime-language` packages into a single runtime package for the target language.
